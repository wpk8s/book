[[ch01-what-will-be-used]]
== Everything we are going to use

In this chapter I'm going to introduce you to all the tools and online
resources that will be used in this book, so you could go ahead and be
able to make a comparison for the online services to be able to make
later choices. I do not want to convince you for any specific one, I
will demonstrate that same recipes can run with almost no modification
in any of them, so what you will learn is portable, not vendor locked
in.

=== Tools

==== MicroK8S

*MicroK8s* was initially designed to be used as a small quick Kubernetes
cluster for local development. One of the core ideas of containers was
imutability, so, what you are running locally, it will run also
identical out there in production setup. It has evolved to a production
grade solution that can run single or multi-machine clusters, on x86-64
and arm64 platforms.

To disclose how I became a fan of MicroK8s, was at the moment I
discovered I could experiment with it on a Raspberry Pi 4 I had and it
simply impressed me that in a few minutes I had a Kubernetes cluster and
I could just start a WordPress experiment I was working on without any
changes.
