== Introduction

I'm so glad you have opened the first book I've wrote and do hope you
are a passionate WordPress developer or system engineer who wants to
learn how to use http://j.mp/2YPGTO0[Kubernetes] using the simple
certified distribution http://j.mp/3pZ5yeP[MicroK8s], a product
developed by http://j.mp/2N0S5F1[Canonical], the company behind
http://j.mp/2YUKmL6[Ubuntu] Linux distribution and other products,
offered for free with commercial support available. MicroK8s is open
source with http://j.mp/3cPXHN4[code] available on Github, where bugs
and issues can be reported and discussed.

This book is full of ready to use solutions and recipes for deploying
even the most advanced WordPress websites in the public cloud, ensuring
high security, high performance, high availability, and remove the many
hours of recovering from disasters and having to write embarasing
reports to the clients or managers.

I will introduce you to the wonderful world of observability and
monitoring enjoying those cool dashboards you might have seen in video
presentations or screenshots from tech stuff of large companies.

The book is strongly opinionated on how things are done, but I do hope
that by learning, you can adapt to your own needs, choices and thoughts
and even do it better. I do not want to enforce anyone in only my way,
it was purely simple to exemplify everything by using specific vendors,
services and how I did it in past years. Things can be done in many
other ways and as you learn a few fundamental ones, you will be able to
create yourself alternatives.

I will start with a basic way of getting a local setup, equivalent of
what we will use in the cloud, so you start to understand how could you
experiment locally quickly or even have a local version to work with
WordPress identical to how it will be in the cloud. This ensures
identical web server setup, with identical php, mysql versions and any
extra services.

Than we shall dive in starting in the cloud, first with a single node
example, following with how to setup WordPress either to benefit of it's
auto updates functionality, or to lock and enforce exact core, plugins
and themes versions by managing ourselves the code, versioning it in git
and setting up the minimal http://j.mp/2OgLQgP[CI/CD] setup using
http://j.mp/3aFS5SL[GitHub Actions] to build automatically container
images that will be simply deployed in our MicroK8s cluster. Will
explore testing automation for WordPress, helpfull for plugin and theme
developers. Also, I shall present how to use
https://bit.ly/2LtvPmK[Roots Bedrock] as alternative to standard
WordPress version, a more modern alternative for developers building
custom web applications with WordPress at it's foundation.

We'll expand the cluster to multi node setup, extend the storage to
support replication and being usable by multiple containers, discovering
how to do horizontal scaling of WordPress, to avoid errors, for example
like when a popular WooCommerce shop has issues during Black Friday. No
more 503 or 504 HTTP errors. Horizontal scalling is the technique used
by the large websites that seemed like some black magic to many small
companies, but with Kubernetes it is something simple, not anymore a
magic recipe available only to large corporations. It also could save a
lot of money compared to classic vertical scalling (increasing server
size) which comes with mandatory short to possible long unavailability
time and waisted resources.

I shall explain you how to setup HTTPS with special created
certificates, using CDN services like http://j.mp/3tyYl7B[CloudFlare]
with origin verification and allowing requests to come strictly from it
and your extra allowed IP addresses increasing the security of the
website for free at a total different level. Will discover the benefits
of security and optimizations services offered by providers like
CloudFlare which would be more expensive to be managed by ourselves.

We'll dive in extending WordPress to use http://j.mp/3rHt6pl[Elastic
Search] for fastest search possible on websites with huge amount of
data, making WooCommerce websites with millions of articles providing
response time from seconds to milliseconds.

Will add http://j.mp/3aFf9Bk[Redis] service to ensure shared php session
management is working perfect when using horizontal scaling, benefiting
extra for object caching, and page caching shared between any number of
workers of the same website.

Will look in setting up our own improved email sending service,
capturing logs and ensuring many expected rules of throteling email
amount not to be marked as a spam source.

We shall setup http://j.mp/3pY8wAt[Prometheus],
http://j.mp/2MERGbe[Grafana] and http://j.mp/3oRdWMc[Elastic Stack] to
gain power of every metric of our cluster, services and WordPress
websites, have access with almost instant search over all logs from
everything. Will deep dive in capturing slow requests and discovering
which is the offending service, code or query that caused it. Also setup
almost instant http://j.mp/36PFXOd[alerts] for anything concerning us,
many times allowing us to fix problems before disasters would happen.

If you really want to master that, I do recommend you read the book
chapter by chapter and at same time practice each example, experiment
more by changing, hacking the examples, tweak as you think best. For me,
this way allowed me to learn, and I decided as for my passion for
WordPress, to put everything in this book optimized for WordPress. I'm
always open to learn better ways and do not hesitate to contact me if
you have something to share and you'd be glad to see it in updated
versions of this book.

I really hope you will enjoy this book, as much as I enjoyed writing it.

PS: This book is in the process of writing right now, with a short free
edition introducing to the basic concepts and an ongoing long version
available to be buy at https://j.mp/2LxX6EE[Leanpub]. Buying the book
supports me to continue writing it. I have started creating the video
course complementing the book, allowing me to show you in real time
everything detailed in the book, which will be available soon on Udemy.
