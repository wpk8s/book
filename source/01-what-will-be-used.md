# Everything we are going to use

In this chapter I'm going to introduce you to all the tools and online resources that will be used in this book, so you could go ahead and be able to make a comparison for the online services to be able to make later choices. I do not want to convince you for any specific one, I will demonstrate that same recipes can run with almost no modification in any of them, so what you will learn is portable, not vendor locked in.

## Tools

{#id-microk8s}
### MicroK8S

**MicroK8s** was initially designed to be used as a small quick Kubernetes cluster for local development. One of the core ideas of containers was imutability, so, what you are running locally, it will run also identical out there in production setup. It has evolved to a production grade solution that can run single or multi-machine clusters, on x86-64 and arm64 platforms.

To disclose how I became a fan of MicroK8s, was at the moment I discovered I could experiment with it on a Raspberry Pi 4 I had and it simply impressed me that in a few minutes I had a Kubernetes cluster and I could just start a WordPress experiment I was working on without any changes.
